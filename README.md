## Description

This is a full stack project developed with a focus on learning. Throughout its development, I deepened my understanding of several fundamental concepts within the Next.js ecosystem, including:

- Styling: Different approaches to styling applications in Next.js, primarily using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

- Optimizations: Techniques to optimize images, fonts, and links, improving both performance and user experience.

- Routing: Creation of nested layouts and dynamic pages using the file-based routing system.

- Data Fetching: Setting up a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database on Vercel and applying best practices for data fetching and streaming.

- Search and Pagination: Implementation of search and pagination features using URL parameters.

- Mutating Data: Using React Server Actions to update data and revalidate the Next.js cache.

- Error Handling: Handling general errors and customizing 404 pages.

- Validation and Accessibility: Server-side form validation and enhancements to improve accessibility.

- Authentication: Integration with NextAuth.js and Middleware to handle access control and user authentication.

- Metadata and SEO: Adding metadata to optimize SEO and improve the appearance of content when shared on social platforms.
